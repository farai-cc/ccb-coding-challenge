# CCB Coding Challenge

Your client has tasked you with making a RESTful API to support the ultimate Moviegoers Guide suite of applications.
They are asking for an API that serves up:

* A list of movies
  * The user should be able to search the movies by title
  * The user should be able to filter the movies by rating
  * The user should be able to filter the movies by category
* Movie details for each movie
* A list of actors in a movie

## Getting Started

To begin with this application, first you must install all of the dependencies by navigating to the /ccb directory and typing the command below into the terminal:

```
$npm install
```

Once all of the dependencies are installed, next you need to create a new schema called "sakila" in your mysql database.

Once the new schema is created, run the command below in your terminal to seed the new schema with the necessary data for the api:

```
$npm run seed
```

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
